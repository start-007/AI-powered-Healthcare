# AI for the Healthcare

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies becoming ever present in modern business and everyday life is also steadily being applied to healthcare.
The use of AI in healthcare has the potential to assist healthcare providers in many aspects of patient care and administration processes,
helping them improve upon existing solutions and overcome challenges faster. Most AI technologies have strong relevance to the 
healthcare organizations. And while some articles suggest that use of AI in healthcare can perform just as well or better 
than humans at certain procedures, such as diagnosing diseases, it will be a significant number of years before AI in healthcare replaces humans 
for a board range of medical tasks.  9 million people die every year without proper healthcare or access to healthcare. AI can help improve outcomes for
